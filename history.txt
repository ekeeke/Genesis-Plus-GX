-----------
[Genesis]
- many sourcecode cleanup and optimization
- completely rewrote EEPROM emulation: now support all known EEPROM types (24C01-24C65) and mappers (Sega, Acclaim, EA, Codemasters)
used in a few games (now use internal game database) as external RAM. This should at least fix save support in the following games:

- added "TV Mode" option to enable automatic switching to PAL(50Hz) TV mode when the Genesis runs in PAL mode
- added "Xshift" & "Yshift" settings to let you adjust display area position while keeping the original aspect ratio
- added option to disable/enable SSG-EG support in FM cores: this special mode is indeed not properly emulated and some games might sound wrong when enabled
- removed "CPU Type" option, you can also now force Region (JAP/EUR/USA) without reseting the game, choose USA or JAP for 60hz, EUR for 50hz, this can be useful to bypass game region protection at startup.


20/07/2007:
-----------
[Genesis]
- corrected TeamPlayer support: fix multiplayer in Gauntlet 4 (Sept. version), Pengo and a lot of others
- added J-Cart support: enable multiplayer in Codemasters games (Pete Sampras, Micromachines games, Super Skidmarks)

- added preliminary support for unmapped protection device: fix some unlicensed games with special built-in hardware (Squirell King, Lion King 2...)
- added "Soft Reset" combo (in game, use L+Z triggers): this should be like pressing the RESET button on a real Genesis and this is required
  in some games to enable special features or even complete the game (ex: X-Men).

[NGC]
- added separate configuration for PortA/PortB inputs (GAMEPAD, MULTITAP or NONE, see Joypad Config): this let you setting
  PORTB as unplugged, which is needed in some games to access special modes or enable cheat codes (Alien Storm, X-Men...)
- Freezestate & SRAM files are now compressed (using zlib)
- FreezeState & SRAM files can now be saved/loaded to/from SDCARD: located in /genplus/saves/ from the root of your SDCARD

- added user-transparent SRAM autoload (detection order is MCARD then SDCARD, SLOTA then SLOTB)
- "System reboot" is now used for console reboot and SD/PSO reload (if detected)
- added new font: now use original IPL font, extracted from Bootrom
- modified controls when going into the rom selection menu (DVD or SDCARD):
   . use B button to go up one directory
   . use Z button to quit the file selection menu 
   . use L/R triggers to go down/up one full page
   . use Left/Right buttons or Analog stick to scroll the selected entry's filename when it can't be full displayed
- various menu rearrangment, minor bugfixes & sourcecode cleanup


21/06/2007:
-----------
- added 4.7GB DVD support for WII drives (the maximal allowed size for Gamecube DVD is still 1.35GB)
- removed MPAL video timings, always use 60Hz NTSC: fix display problems for PAL wii users (no more PAL50 version needed)
- added Console Reboot option in main menu (IPL Reboot)
- added Multitap support (EA 4-Way Play and Sega Teamplayer): allowed up to four players in games supporting those peripherals
- added partial Sega Menacer lightgun support (use Analog Stick): automatically set when detecting the 6-in-1 Menacer game


18/05/2007:
-----------
- you can now switch between FM cores without reseting the game. FM registers  value are automatically restored when switching.
- modified PAL framesync a little bit: the 20ms period is now applied between the start of 2 consecutive frames,
no more between the end of the previous and the start of the next one, which seems more correct to me
- removed the previous VINT timings modification because it brokes some games (Rocket Knight, Thunderforce III,...)
- added automatic Timing configuration (VDP latency, VINT timing & alternate Line Timing) at game loading, based upon specific romname detection.
This means you can still modify some of these options afterwards but they are now automatically set/unset when loading a game which need
special timing fixes. These fixes are also automatically desactivated when the current game doesn't need them.

For information, games that are actually detected and need special timings to run properly are:
 .Legend of Galahad & Road Rash series (single line not rendered properly)
 .Sesame Street Counting Cafe (don't boot)
 .Chaos Engine/Soldiers of Fortune (graphic glitches on scrolling)

-----------
- corrected MAX_OUTPUT value in SN76496 core: fix PSG sound (SFX) volume
- removed unused sound buffer allocation


26/03/2007:
-----------
- added DVD automount: automatically call libogc DVD_Mount function if ISO PVD reading failed (idea taken from softdev's last neocdredux release). This may be useful for loading roms from a DVD after booting from SDLOAD or after stopping DVD motor.
- added "DVD motor off" feature, like in others emulators
